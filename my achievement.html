<strong><h1>MY ACHIEVEMENT</h1></strong>




<p><h3><font color="yellow">
My name is <i>Malik Bashir Olamilekan</i>, a native of Kwara state. I was  born and brought up at Ojo, Lagos state. In Ojo, i had my primary and secondary school education.</br>

I am a bonofide student of department of library and information science, 200lvl in kwara state university.</br> 
 
<b><h2><i>MY ACHIEVEMENTS</i></h2></b> 
<h3>  One of my major achievements is being able to understand my religion <b>ISLAM</b>, after my secondary education, i proceeded to study</br>
more about my religion <b> ISLAM </b> at <b> MUHYDEEN COLLEGE OF EDUCATION </b>, kulende, sango, Ilorin.
It was a very big experience cause that was my firt time of travelling from Lagos to Ilorin.</br>

Right there in Muhydeen college of education, i was able to know more about <b> ISLAM </b>, learnt how to speak Arabic Language, had more knowledge about <b>ALLAH</b> [swt], His books and His prophets,</br>
the teachings and <b>HADEETHS<b> of prophet <b>MUHAMMAD</b> [saw] became a part of me. <br> 
During my first year at MUHYDEEN college of education, i was nominated as the <b>Nakib</b> (class rep.), i might not</br>
be the best among my class mates but i was one of the best of all during my days there. <br>
Although it was a six years programme but i had to drop out after the first three (3) years, which was after the completion</br>
of my <b>SHA'ADAH</b> (thalitha idadi), i had to drop out because of some certain reasons, after dropping of Arabic school, i decided to further my Western education which i am currently on, right in Kwara state university.</br>
Despite being a fresher right here in KWASU, i hope to achieve greater things here too, in shaa Allah. <br>
Despite dropping out of Arabic school, i still say a very big <b>ALHAMDULILLAH</b> cause being able to understand my religion</br>
and being able to speak and understand Arabic language even though not too fluent is a very big previledge for me and also makes it one of <strong> MY BIGGEST ACHIEVEMENTS</strong/> for now. <br>
This is my first ever webpage design and</br>
i am so happy and glad to be the author of it.
